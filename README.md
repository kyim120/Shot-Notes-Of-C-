# C++ Programming Languages

This guide is designed for beginners to help them understand the fundamental concepts of C++ programming. Each section explains a core feature of C++ with an easy-to-understand example.

## 1. Functions in C++
Functions allow breaking the program into smaller, reusable pieces, making the code more manageable and readable.

### Explanation:
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help in reducing redundancy and improving code structure.

### Syntax:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b);

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 10);
    cout << "Sum: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

## 2. Loops in C++
Loops allow executing a block of code multiple times, which is useful for automating repetitive tasks.

### Explanation:
Loops help in iterating through arrays, processing lists, or executing operations repeatedly under certain conditions.

### Types of Loops:
1. **For Loop** - Used when the number of iterations is known.
```cpp
for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

2. **While Loop** - Used when the number of iterations is unknown but depends on a condition.
```cpp
int i = 1;
while(i <= 5) {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
```

3. **Do-While Loop** - Similar to `while`, but guarantees at least one execution.
```cpp
int i = 1;
do {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
} while(i <= 5);
```

## 3. Arrays in C++
Arrays allow storing multiple values in a single variable, making data management easier.

### Explanation:
An array is a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.

### Syntax:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    // Accessing elements
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## 4. Pointers in C++
Pointers allow direct memory access and manipulation, which helps in dynamic memory allocation and data structures like linked lists.

### Explanation:
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

### Syntax:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    int* ptr = &num; // Pointer stores address of num

    cout << "Value of num: " << num << endl;
    cout << "Address of num: " << &num << endl;
    cout << "Pointer points to: " << ptr << endl;
    cout << "Value at pointer: " << *ptr << endl; // Dereferencing

    return 0;
}
```

## 5. Classes in C++
Classes are the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. They allow organizing data and methods together.

### Explanation:
A class is a user-defined data type that contains attributes (variables) and methods (functions).

### Syntax:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    int speed;

    void display() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Speed: " << speed << " km/h" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car1;
    car1.brand = "Toyota";
    car1.speed = 120;
    car1.display();

    return 0;
}
```

---

## 6. Structures in C++
Structures (`struct`) allow grouping different types of data under one name.

### Explanation:
A structure is similar to a class but does not support access modifiers like `private` by default.

### Syntax:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Student {
    string name;
    int age;
    float marks;
};

int main() {
    Student s1 = {"Alice", 20, 85.5};

    cout << "Name: " << s1.name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << s1.age << endl;
    cout << "Marks: " << s1.marks << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Summary Table
| Feature     | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| **Functions** | Blocks of code that perform specific tasks. |
| **Loops** | Repeat a block of code multiple times (`for`, `while`, `do-while`). |
| **Arrays** | Store multiple values of the same type. |
| **Pointers** | Store memory addresses of variables. |
| **Classes** | Blueprints for objects in Object-Oriented Programming. |
| **Structures** | Similar to classes but used for grouping related data. |
